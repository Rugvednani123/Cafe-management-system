Project Title: Simple Cafe Management System using Python (Console-based)
üìù Project Introduction:
This Cafe Management System is a beginner-friendly, console-based project developed using core Python. It simulates the basic operations of a real-world cafe, allowing users to view the menu, place multiple orders, and receive a bill summary‚Äîall from the terminal.

The system is designed to:

Greet the user with a warm welcome message and display a menu of available items with their prices.

Accept multiple orders from the user using a loop and ensure only valid items are added.

Maintain a running total of the bill and keep track of the ordered items.

Display the final order summary and total amount after the user finishes ordering.

This project demonstrates fundamental Python concepts such as:

Dictionaries for menu management

Loops for continuous ordering

Conditionals for input validation

String formatting and input handling

Basic list operations to track orders

It is ideal for learning how to interact with users through input/output and manage small sets of data dynamically during program execution.
